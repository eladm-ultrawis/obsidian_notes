### Goals
- Understand how to extract 3D information from images, such as location of certain objects.
- Project 3D models onto the image (augmented reality)

Subjects:
- Camera calibration & distortion correction:
	- understand different distortion models:
- Camera models - Pinhole, FOV
- 

Resources:
- [statlect - matrix algebra](https://www.statlect.com/matrix-algebra/) 
  contains a lots of proofs about matrix algebra
- MIT 18.065 [Matrix Methods In Data Analysis, Signal Processing, And Machine Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)
- 
- [MIT 18.657 - Mathematics of machine Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-657-mathematics-of-machine-learning-fall-2015/)
  - discusses mainly the math of classic machine learning
  - no videos - just notes (looks ok though)
