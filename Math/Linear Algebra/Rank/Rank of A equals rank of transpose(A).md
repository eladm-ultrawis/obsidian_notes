- $rank(A) = rank(A^T)$ 
- [stackexchange proofs](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/332908/looking-for-an-intuitive-explanation-why-the-row-rank-is-equal-to-the-column-ran)

Intuition:
- a matrix $A_{m\times n}$  represent a system of $m$ equations with $n$ variables ($A=0$)
- The column rank is the number of independent variables (don't depend on each other) 
- The row rank is the number of independent equations (independent equations are equations that don't derive from each other)
- each independent equation determines the value of one independent variable at most
