[[Determinant is the product of the eigenvalues]] and [[Eigenvalues of a Kronecker product are permutations of its multiplicants]] So

if $A$ is of order $m$ and $B$ is of order $n$ (note the powers are reversed!)

$$
\det(A\bigotimes B) = \prod_{i,j}\lambda_i \mu_j = \prod \lambda_i^n \prod \lambda_j^m = \det(A)^n \det(B)^m
$$
