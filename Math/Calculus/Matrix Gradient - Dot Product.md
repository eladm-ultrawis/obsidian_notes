- The gradient is usually computed for vector functions (vector input, scalar output)
- What about gradients of a matrix functions (matrix in, scalar out)?

Hilbert spaces
- simply vector spaces with an inner product
- inner product should have the following properties:
  
Inner Product For matrices $\langle A,B \rangle = trace(A^TB)$
