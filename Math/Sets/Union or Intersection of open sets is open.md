Union: if $x$ is part of a union, than it belongs to one of the open sets, there is always a ball around it entirely in that set and hence its a union ($x$ is an interior point of the union)
Intersection: $x$ is now part of each of the different sets, there is a ball around it in each set, choose the smallest ball and this ball should be in the intersection of them all.
