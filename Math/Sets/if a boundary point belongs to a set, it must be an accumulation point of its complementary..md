- $x$ is a boundary point of $S$. 
- let us assume $x \in S$ 
- we want to show that for any ball around it, there is at least one point in $R^n - S$ distinct from $x$ 
- from the definition of $x$ as a boundary point, every ball around it has at least one point from the complementary set, since $x$ is not in the complementary set, then this point cannot be $x$ itself. and this is the definition of an accumulation point.
