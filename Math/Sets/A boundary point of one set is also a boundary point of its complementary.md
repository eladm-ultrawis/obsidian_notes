- $x$ is a boundary point of $S \subset R^n$
- we want to show that $x$ is also a boundary point of $R^n - S$ 

This really follows directly from the definition of a boundary point. a boundary point is defined such that every ball around it contains at least on point from the set and one point from its complementary.
