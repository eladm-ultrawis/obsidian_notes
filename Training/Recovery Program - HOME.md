### Weakpoints
1. Poor wrist strength - makes you rotate when hanging
2. Weak Pinky 
3. Not investing enough time

Things that helped
- while wrist curls - using the cushioning block on the arm rest
- pinky arm lifts - gripping the tension block sideways
- use interval timer (Always!) to track time and avoid procrastinating
- have a plan
- doing a proper warm up - at least 45 minutes solely invested in warming up
