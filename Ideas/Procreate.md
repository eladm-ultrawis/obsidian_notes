	- layered approach
	- single point of truth (no state duplication)
	- unidirectional dataflow.

	- unlike C - it is easier to create abstractions with it and write less code.
	The Bad:

	- can be super complex and ugly
	- hard to use correctly (unlike dart for example)
	- easy to use incorrectly

	- Ultrawis: Flutter Embedder
	- Ultrawis: Realtime panoramic stiching, automatic calibration process (with a press of a button)
	- Ultrawis: future ideas
	- RGO: Pose Graph Optimization (rotation averaging), optimized feature matching, triangulation, mostly isolated work, nothing to write home about.

	- from understanding what they did wrong, and how to do this better
