### Intro
Collision avoidance systems require 

### Goal
- detect, classify & segment jobsite elements that might collide with that tower crane:
  - neighbor cranes
  - 
- deduce a 3D BB around these objects
- integrate the data into our anti collision avoidance system (static objects)
- provide self reliant anti collision system that does not rely on inter crane communication and manual calibration.

### Advantage over existing solutions

Current anti collision systems require manual calibration and setup in order to function correctly.
Usually, the system administrator configures prohibited zones, enters the crane dimensions etc.
The main disadvantages
- requires intricate configurations of all crane dimensions
- even after calibration process, the crane may lift different cargo types with an unknown dimension.
